        <h1>Web Security</h1>
        <h4>February 1, 2016</h4>
        <p>Web security is one of the hottest issues going on these days. Whether it's Google reading all your emails to serve you ads, Apple tracking your location for no clear reason, or the NSA reading all your Facebook posts (and they never even drop me a like! THANKS OBAMA), it seems like security is the thing that everybody wants, nobody has, and, after a little research, nobody really knows much about either. </p>
        <p>I started doing a little research on web security, and what developers can do to help write more secure code, and I came up with what is simultaneously a wealth and complete lack of information. Considering that major companies spend big money on security teams, I assumed that it would be a massive, but well-documented scenario.</p>
        <p>Instead, I found a relatively small number of pages offering a handful of different ideas to help keep your pages safe, but no real set of guidelines besides a small handful of rules and techniques to protect against specific attacks.</p>
        <p>Some are very basic, like avoiding Cross Site Scripting and preventing things like passwords from getting passed on in URLs or otherwise presented to another page or user, and others like not having sensitive data stored in JavaScript files with easily-guessable URLs since that's another way they can be accessed. </p>
        <p>The short of it is that I've now actually realized the truth that there is an entirely separate field of developers focused specifically on security, because there are so many possiblities for how to get oneself into the code if you know your way around the language. I'm excited but terrified by the idea of having yet another milestone in my dev journey now - first learn to write code, then learn to write good code, and lastly learn to write secure code.</p>
