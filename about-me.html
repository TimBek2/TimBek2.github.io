				<h1>Background</h1>
				<p>My name is Tim and I come from New Canaan, CT (or wait, parts unknown? yeah, parts unknown.)</p>
				<p>I'm interested in code things, but I also enjoy cooking, reading, and eating while reading</p>
				<p>I grew up on the East Coast, but went to college in California, at Santa Clara University. Both are pretty good to me, but in the end, the pizza won me back.</p>
				<p>I like coffee, a lot. I'm actually working on a project that will let you know if your coffee pot is ready, and if you have a shared coffee machine situation, it can keep track of who killed the pot and let you know if they refilled it. in common with me is that I was trained to juggle by a Barnum and Bailey clown</p>
