        <h1>Enumerable #Map</h1>
        <h4>January 10, 2016</h4>
        <p>The method #map for an enumerable is a very powerful method that we can use while working in Ruby. It's used on an array, and behaves very similarly to the #each iterator. The main difference, however, is that when #each is used on an array, it returns the result of running the code block on each object in the array, and then returns the original array. #map, on the other hand, returns the results of the code block, as well as a new array that contains the results of running the code block on each of the original objects. This is very valuable for us, because it allows us to more quickly run a block of code through an array and then immediately pass that into another block. For example, this line of code will allow us to take an input array and in one line convert it into a hash with a default value of 0: hash = Hash[arr.map {|x| [x, 0]}]</p>
        <p>#map can also be used with a bang #map! to become a destructive method, which will alter the original array as opposed to returning the result but leaving the source array as it is. </p>
        <p>This kind of functionality will definitely be useful later, when we start making more complicated programs that need to utilize the functionality of different classes. If nothing else, this is useful as a quick way to manipulate an array and then convert it into a hash.  </p>
