        <h1>Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects</h1>
        <h4>January 25, 2016</h4>
        <p>Happy Monday! We've officially completed the Ruby portion of Phase 0, and have moved on to the last major chunk, JavaScript. JavaScript is among the most reviled languages for its various inconsistencies and confusion, but it's also one of the most used languages, since it works in every browser across all devices and it's just so powerful.</p>
        <p>Coming from Ruby, there's a lot of familiar syntax in JavaScript that isn't so scary to us. You might even be able to look at some JavaScript code and figure out what it's going to do based on what you can recognize. However, once you get to the writing, you'll come to see how different the syntax is. Remember - JavaScript is a much less open-ended language than Ruby, but it gives </p>

        <p>We could've added more methods to continue defining those methods and variables, but it turns out there's actually a shortcut to this!</p>

        <p>Those bits of code with attr_ are attribute modules, and they create instance variables with the given string identifier, quickly and easily. attr_reader creates a method that returns the value of the variable, while attr_writer creates a method called #variable= that changes the value. Both of these methods can be seen with @occupation at the bottom of the block. Attr_accessor, ass seen on line 5, does both attr_reader and attr_writer in one line, for even more magic!</p>
