        <h1>Ruby Classes, Instances, and Objects!</h1>
        <h4>January 18, 2016</h4>
        <p>Happy Monday! Maybe since everyone is sluggish today, they won't notice that all three of those things are the same, at least generally speaking. In Ruby, we can say that every object is an instance of a class, but we can break that down to make a little more sense: </p>
        <p>A CLASS is like the blueprint for objects in Ruby. It provides all the plumbing for an object, such as information it expects, methods that it can use, and error messages it might return. For example:</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/TimBek2/709d86c47f66ddafd0d5.js"></script>
        <p>An OBJECT is the actual, specific example of an object. If you could reach into the computer, it would be the specific, unique example of an object.
        It would be THIS orange, not just a blueprint of an orange.</p>
        <p>An INSTANCE is a little more abstract, it is the duration of the occurance of the object. While that sounds like some snake-oil talk, it is significant because it explains why instance variables behave the way they do - they exist within that specific instance of an object.</p>
        <p>Classes are useful because they allow us to store information however we want, and we can create the tools that we want to use on this information so they're built right into it. Instance methods help facilitate this by holding onto their values outside of the method that they're initialized within. Thanks to this, we can set the traits of an object and then create methods to operate with this information in a plug-and-play fashion, rather than having to create each variable within each method and then make sure that it passes the right information on as well. </p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/TimBek2/12324a1a0796d639d47c.js"></script>
        <p>We could've added more methods to continue defining those methods and variables, but it turns out there's actually a shortcut to this!</p>
        <script src="https://gist.github.com/TimBek2/932cd24132f52bc8eda2.js"></script>
        <p>Those bits of code with attr_ are attribute modules, and they create instance variables with the given string identifier, quickly and easily. attr_reader creates a method that returns the value of the variable, while attr_writer creates a method called #variable= that changes the value. Both of these methods can be seen with @occupation at the bottom of the block. Attr_accessor, ass seen on line 5, does both attr_reader and attr_writer in one line, for even more magic!</p>
