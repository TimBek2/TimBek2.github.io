        <h1>Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects</h1>
        <h4>January 25, 2016</h4>
        <p>Happy Monday! We've officially completed the Ruby portion of Phase 0, and have moved on to the last major chunk, JavaScript. JavaScript is among the most reviled languages for its various inconsistencies and confusion, but it's also one of the most used languages, since it works in every browser across all devices and it's just so powerful.</p>
        <p>Coming from Ruby, there's a lot of familiar syntax in JavaScript that isn't so scary to us. You might even be able to look at some JavaScript code and figure out what it's going to do based on what you can recognize. However, once you get to the writing, you'll come to see how different the syntax is.</p>
        <p>Today we're learning about two similar, but different, container objects in computer programming - Ruby Hashes and JavaScript Objects. Both of these are unordered lists of {a,b} value pairs, with Ruby calling them keys and values, while JavaScript identifies them as properties and the value of the property instead. </p>

        <script src="https://gist.github.com/TimBek2/d117e0f1662f3e6b6359.js"></script>
        <p>See how similarly they look? That's about where the similarity ends. Each of these languages has functionality that makes them unique and in some ways, superior to the other language. It always just depends on what you need to accomplish. Ruby is much easier to iterate through this container with, while JavaScript can do cool things like assign functions to property names, which allows you to create functions as Object properties, something you certainly can't do with Hashes in Ruby. Those can then be denoted in dot notation, which is a fairly legible form for JavaScript to be written in, and as far as I've found in my research, is generally preferrable from within the community.</p>

        <p>That isn't so bad! Dot notation can be useful because it can help us end up making some very readable code, if you approach the naming of properties correctly. Remember that Ruby doesn't have the ability to assign a function to any Hash. You could write a method that operates on Hashes, but all the pieces wouldn't quite relate to each other the same way.</p>
        <p>Thats all we've got for today, but tune in again next week for more crazy wacky fun blog adventures!</p>
