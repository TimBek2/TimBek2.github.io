      What are the benefits of version control?
        Version control is first and foremost a safety net utilized by devs. It allows them to save a separate instance of the code in its entirety every time they submit a change, and the descriptions of these changes serve as a log for the code. If at any time unfixable errors are made, the dev(s) can simply revert back to a previous state in the code and try again. The biggest additional benefit is that with cloud-based version control platforms like GitHub, multiple devs can work on the same piece of code by working independently on separate branches that they create from the original, and then merging the changes later after they've both reviewed the others' changes.

       How does git help you keep track of changes?
        Git helps you keep track of changes by saving an instance of the code every time a commit is made, which is when a new set of changes are committed to the master copy of the code. Best practices dictates that every time a change is committed, a message of varying detail is left explaining what changes were submitted, so by checking the log later a dev can see the evolution of the code through each commit made.

        Why use GitHub to store your code?
        Github allows you to store your work remotely, which allows you to access it later if you need to use a different machine to get to it. Furthermore, it allows other devs to look at your code where it's posted, as well as fork it to make changes, suggestions, or improvements later. Depending on what the terms of your license are, the behavior allowed with your work is subject to your wishes.
